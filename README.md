# MongoDB $inc operator error
This example demonstrates an incorrect usage of the MongoDB `$inc` operator.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field by a specified value. However, in this example, we are attempting to increment the field using a string value, which will result in an error.

The solution shows the correct way to increment a field using `$inc` by using a numerical value instead of a string.
